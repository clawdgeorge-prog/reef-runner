- Schedule: 3x daily (1am, 9am, 1pm)
- Backup check: 5x daily (4am, 8am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm)

### Projects
| Project | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| OpenClaw Agent | Live | Personal AI assistant |
| Business Listings Scraper | Live | Utah/Idaho SMB acquisitions |
| Earnings Prediction | Live | Multi-AI analysis |
| RAG Knowledge Base | Live | Local semantic search |
| Self-Improvement System | Live | Automated tests, health |
| Vector Memory | In Progress | Semantic search |
| Mark Paul/CMI Briefing | Complete | Meeting prep |

## Preferences
- Casual tone
- Always back up openclaw.json before changes
- Proactive approach - fix issues without asking
- Keep George (main session) on OpenAI when configured
- Keep routine cron jobs, scraping, and spawned agents on MiniMax by default
- Only switch subagents/workloads to OpenAI when Brant and George agree it’s needed

## Key Learnings

### Browser Automation
- Sub-agents struggle with AI chat sites (Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini)
- Earnings analysis better run in main session
- ~600s timeout, 3 retries per site

### Security Notes (March 7)
- AI OSINT can build complete profiles from name in 15 min
- Voice cloning from photos now possible
- Agent security with shell access is risky

## File Locations
- OpenClaw: ~/.openclaw/
- Business Listings: ~/.openclaw/business-listings/
- RAG KB: ~/.openclaw/workspace/rag-kb/
- Self-Improvement: ~/.openclaw/self-improvement/
- Memory: ~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/

## Lessons Learned (Critical)

### Memory Persistence (March 10)
- I wake up fresh each session - no memory of previous sessions unless it's in files
- MUST check vector memory when I don't know something user asks about
- AGENTS.md updated with CRITICAL reminder to check vector DB
- Game was created but never logged - found only via file search
- Joke cron existed but delivery was broken - fixed delivery config
- **Always save important things to MEMORY.md or daily notes immediately**

## Neon Snake X Game

- Full-featured snake game with neon aesthetics, power-ups, achievements, difficulty levels
- Open in browser to play anytime: `open ~/.openclaw/workspace/game.html`
